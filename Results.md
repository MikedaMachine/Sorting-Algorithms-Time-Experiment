         The time complexity experiment revealed that the selection sort appears to be 
         overall a faster algorithm. Though both algorithms have a complexity of O(n^2), the 
         method in which they are processed differs. Selection sort performs less swaps than Bubble sort  
         when iterating though each loop. Therefore, less swaps equals faster processing time. When 
         comparing my spreadsheet results using the percentage difference formula (100 * |a - b| / ((a + b) / 2)).
         I found this observation to be accurate. For arrays of size 500, I observed a 66.6% difference in processing
         time between the two methods. The array of 2500 returns a difference of 80.7%. Lastly, the array of 5000 returns  
         a difference of 39.4%. In conclusion, the selection sort is a preferred algorithm for processing speed at 
         more than 60% percent faster. While for large computing, the speed benefits begin to decline. Making selection 
         and bubble sorting more comparable to each other under the O(n^2) time complexity.
