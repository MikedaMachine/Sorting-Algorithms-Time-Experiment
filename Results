>  The time complexity experiment revealed that the selection sort appears to be overall a faster algorithm. Though both algorithms <br>
>  have a complexity of O(n^2), the method in which they are processed differs. Selection sort performs less swaps than Bubble sort <br> 
>  when iterating though each loop. Therefore, less swaps equals faster processing time. When comparing my spreadsheet results using <br> 
>  the percentage difference formula (100 * |a - b| / ((a + b) / 2)). I found this observation to be accurate. For arrays of size 500, I observed <br>
>  a 66.6% difference in processing time between the two methods. The array of 2500 returns a difference of 80.7%. Lastly, the array of 5000 returns <br> 
>  a difference of 39.4%. In conclusion, the selection sort is a preferred algorithm for processing speed at more than 60% percent faster. While for <br> 
>  large computing, the speed benefits begin to decline. Making selection and bubble sorting more comparable to each other under the O(n^2) time complexity.
